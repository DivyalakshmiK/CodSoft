# CodSoft
A repository of all my tasks during my internship at CodSoft.

The codesoft internship consists of a number of tasks which on completion will yield us a successful internship. These are the tasks provided by CodSoft.

TASK 1 - CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES:

    Building a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. If-else statements or pattern matching techniques are used to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses. This will give a basic understanding of natural language processing and conversation flow.

TASK 2 - TIC-TAC-TOE AI:

    Implementing an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. Algorithms like Minimax with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning can be used to make the AI player unbeatable.This helps in understanding game theory and basic search algorithms.

TASK 3 - IMAGE CAPTIONING:

    Combining computer vision and natural language processing to build an image captioning AI. Pre-trained image recognition models like VGG or ResNet can be used to extract features from images, and then a recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model to generate captions for those images.

TASK 4 - RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM:

    Creation of a simple recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their preferences. Techniques like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering can be employed to recommend movies, books, or products to users.

TASK 5 - FACE DETECTION AND RECOGNITION:
    
    Developing an AI application that can detect and recognize faces in images or videos. Pre-trained face detection models like Haar cascades or deep learning-based face detectorscan be used, and optionally face recognition capabilities using techniques like Siamese networks or ArcFacecan be added.
